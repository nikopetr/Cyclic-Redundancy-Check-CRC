# Cyclic-Redundancy-Check-CRC
Implementation of a Cyclic Redundancy Check in Java

## About the project
CRC code is an error detection code used usually on digital networks to detect random changes (errors) data sent. For each block of data consisting of k bits, the transmitter creates a sequence of n bits such that the total sequence of k + n bits that turns out to be exactly divisible by a predetermined number P. In then the receiver receives the sequence of k + n bits together with P. If dividing the sequence by P does not occur then the message has reach to deteriorate.
